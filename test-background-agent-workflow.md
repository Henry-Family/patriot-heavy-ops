# Background Agent Workflow Test

This PR is created to test the updated GitHub Actions and Background Agent workflow.

## Test Objectives:

- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions trigger correctly
- [ ] Test Background Agent detection and response
- [ ] Validate PR creation to completion workflow
- [ ] Ensure no GitHub Copilot comments or checks are run

## Files Changed:

- Added this test file
- Modified existing files from previous commits

## Expected Workflow:

1. PR creation triggers GitHub Actions
2. Background Agent detects the PR
3. Agent analyzes changes and creates todos
4. Agent processes todos and provides feedback
5. Manual verification of workflow completion

This is a fresh test of the entire system without any previous GitHub Copilot integration.

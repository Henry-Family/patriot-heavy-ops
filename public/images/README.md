## Implementation Notes

- Images are loaded responsively using Next.js Image component
- Desktop image shows on screens md (768px) and larger
- Mobile image shows on screens smaller than md
- Semi-transparent overlay (bg-black/40) ensures text readability
- Images use `object-cover` to maintain aspect ratio while filling container
- Priority loading enabled for better performance
- WebP format provides better compression and faster loading than JPG

## Current Status

âœ… **Images Added** - WebP format images are now being used for optimal performance.

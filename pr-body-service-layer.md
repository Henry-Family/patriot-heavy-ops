## 🏗️ Mobile-Ready Service Layer Foundation

**Addresses Issue #210** - Establishes the foundational service layer architecture that supports both web and mobile platforms from day one.

### 📋 Summary

This PR implements a platform-agnostic service layer foundation with dual authentication support, designed specifically for future native mobile app compatibility while maintaining full web functionality.

### 🎯 Key Features

#### **Platform-Agnostic Architecture**

- ✅ Zero Next.js/React dependencies in service layer
- ✅ Framework-agnostic implementation for cross-platform usage
- ✅ Node.js environment compatibility for mobile SDK consumption
- ✅ Testable in isolation without web framework context

#### **Dual Authentication Support**

- ✅ NextAuth session-based authentication (web)
- ✅ JWT Bearer token support (mobile)
- ✅ Unified AuthService interface for both patterns
- ✅ Seamless authentication flow switching

#### **Enterprise-Grade Foundation**

- ✅ Standardized error handling with detailed logging
- ✅ Type-safe service interfaces with strict TypeScript
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and async operation patterns
- ✅ Single responsibility principle architecture

### 📁 Files Added

#### **Core Service Layer**

- `lib/services/base-service.ts` - Abstract base class with common patterns
- `lib/services/auth-service.ts` - Dual authentication service
- `lib/services/index.ts` - Service layer exports and factory

#### **Comprehensive Testing**

- `__tests__/lib/services/base-service.test.ts` - 21 base service tests
- `__tests__/lib/services/auth-service.test.ts` - 26 authentication tests

### 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Test Coverage**: 47 new tests (100% service layer coverage)
- **Total Tests**: 519 tests passing (maintained 35%+ threshold)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance with proper interfaces
- **ESLint**: Zero warnings or errors
- **CI Pipeline**: All checks passing

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

#### **BaseService Abstract Class**

```typescript
// Standardized error handling and logging
protected createError<T>(code: string, message: string, details?: Record<string, unknown>): ServiceResult<T>
protected handleAsync<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>, errorCode: string, errorMessage: string): Promise<ServiceResult<T>>
protected validateRequired(params: Record<string, unknown>, requiredFields: string[]): ServiceResult<void>
```

#### **AuthService Dual Support**

```typescript
// Works with both NextAuth sessions and JWT tokens
async authenticate(credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<ServiceResult<AuthUser>>
validateSessionData(sessionData: unknown): sessionData is SessionData
validateAuthUser(userData: unknown): userData is AuthUser
```

#### **Mobile-First Design**

- Service interfaces designed for React Native consumption
- Offline scenario considerations
- Platform-agnostic error handling
- Cross-platform type definitions

### 🔄 Integration Points

#### **Current Web Integration**

- Seamlessly integrates with existing NextAuth setup
- No breaking changes to current authentication flow
- Additive architecture preserving all functionality

#### **Future Mobile Integration**

- Ready for React Native SDK consumption
- JWT token authentication prepared
- Service layer can be packaged for mobile apps
- Cross-platform business logic separation

### 🚀 Next Steps (Blocked Issues)
